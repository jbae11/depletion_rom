We trained a neural network model
to predict \gls{PWR} \gls{UNF} composition given initial enrichment
and burnup. This quick, flexible, medium-fidelity method to
estimate depleted \gls{PWR} fuel assembly compositions is used
to model scenarios in which the \gls{PWR} fuel burnup
and enrichment vary over time.
The \gls{UNF-STANDARDS} \gls{UDB} provided a ground truth on which
the model trained.
We validated the model by comparing the U.S. \gls{UNF} inventory profile
predicted by the model with the \gls{UDB} \gls{UNF} inventory
profile. The neural network yields less than 1\% error for
\gls{UNF} inventory decay heat and activity and less than
2\% error for major isotopic inventory. The neural network model
takes 0.27 seconds for 100 predictions, compared to
118 seconds for 100 \gls{ORIGEN} calculations.

We also implemented this model into \Cyclus, an agent-based
\gls{NFC} simulator, to perform rapid, medium-fidelity
\gls{PWR}
depletion calculations. This model also allows discharge of
batches with assemblies of varying burnup.

Since the original private data cannot be retrieved from the model,
this trained model can provide open-source depletion capabilities to \gls{NFC}
simulators. We show that training an artificial neural network with a
dataset from a complex fuel depletion model
can provide rapid, medium-fidelity depletion capabilities
to large-scale fuel cycle simulations.
