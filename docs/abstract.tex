We trained a neural network model
to predict \gls{PWR} \gls{UNF} composition given initial enrichment
and burnup, to implement a quick, medium-fidelity method to
estimate depleted \gls{PWR} fuel assembly composition in a fuel
cycle simulator.
The \gls{UNF-STANDARDS} \gls{UDB} provided a ground truth on which
the model trained.
We validated the model by comparing the U.S. \gls{UNF} inventory profile
predicted by the model with the \gls{UDB} \gls{UNF} inventory
profile. The neural network yields less than 1\% error of
\gls{UNF} inventory decay heat and activity and less than
2\% error for major isotopic inventory. The neural network model
takes 0.27 seconds for 100 depletion calculations, compared to
the 118 seconds for 100 \gls{ORIGEN} calculations.

We also implemented this model into \Cyclus, an agent-based
\gls{NFC} simulator, to perform rapid, medium-fidelity
\gls{PWR}
depletion calculations. This model also allows discharge of
batches with varying burnup assemblies.

Since the original private data cannot be retrieved from the model,
this trained model allows open-source depletion capabilities to \gls{NFC}
simulators. This method of training an artificial neural network with a
dataset from a complex fuel depletion model
can provide rapid, medium-fidelity depletion capabilities
to large-scale fuel cycle simulations.
